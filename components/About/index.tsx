            I am a fresh graduate Computer Engineering student from Izmir Institute of Technology. 
            I have a special interest in Java and its technologies like Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Hibernate and etc. I mainly focus on Backend Development. 
            On the other hand, I also improve myself in Frontend Development. 
            While learning backend technologies, I also learn some frontend technologies like React and Next.js. 
            I continuously encourage myself to learn new things in software development. 
            I fulfilled my summer internship at Research Ecosystems. 
            I wrote unit and integration tests for a Spring Boot project. 
            Now, I am working as a Frontend Developer in NexArb.
